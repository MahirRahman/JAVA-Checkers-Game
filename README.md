# JAVA-Checkers-Game
- The game uses the JAVA GUI to display the board and pieces.
- It uses OOP concepts like Inheritance and Polymorphism to monitor game piece movement
- When players make different moves, their moves are registered and displayed accordingly using repaint() (one of the Paint features that come with JAVA GUI)
- The project is still under work where it has not yet implemented how to register when pieces change to kings.
